		<h3>Here is a quote from Good Housekeeping on dogs:</h3>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/pets/g4531/cutest-dog-breeds/">
		It's impossible to pick favorites when it comes to dogs. Every single one of them deserves the title of man's best friend, and every single one of them deserves a life full of love, cuddles, and lots and lots of toys.
